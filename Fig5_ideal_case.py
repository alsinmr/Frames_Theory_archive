This script generates an ideal trajectory (Fig. 5) with four motions:
    1) Fast wobbling-in-a-cone
    2) Three-site hopping
    3) Two-site hopping
    4) Isotropic tumbling
    
We take a step-by-step construction first of the motion, based on random
number generation, followed by deconstruction of the total motion using the frame
analysis.

Below, we use the function Ct_D2inf, which is responsible for calculating components
of various correlation values and their equilibrium values

Usage is as follows
Ct,A = ef.Ct_D2inf(v,vXZ,nuZ_F,nuXZ_F,nuZ_f,nuXZ_f,cmpt,mode)

v,vXZ:          Defines the Z-axis and XZ-plane of the frame of the NMR tensor
nuZ_F,nuXZ_F:   Defines the Z-axis and XZ-plane of some outer frame, F, which we
                use to remove all motion of frame F. Optional- omitting will
                result in no outer motion being removed, i.e. calculating in
                lab frame)
nuZ_f,nuXZ_f:   Defines the Z-axis and XZ-plane of some inner frame, f, where we
                calculate the components of the correlation function resulting 
                from motion of f acting on the NMR tensor (where motion of F
                is removed if nuZ_F is provided). nuZ_f, nuXZ_f are optional, 
                and if omitted, calculation will return components of the 
                innermost motion, that is, the motion of the NMR tensor moving
                within frame F (or in the lab frame, if F is also omitted)
cmpt:           Choose which components of the correlation function and 
                equilibrium values to return. Provided as a string, with options
                being a specific component ('00','20','-10', etc.), or a range
                of components ('0p','p0', where the former returns a list of
                5 correlation functions, '0-2','0-1','00','01','02'). Note that
                if all 5 components are required, the '0p' or 'p0' option is much
                faster than looping over this function, since we may recycle 
                many of the calculations
mode:           String, specifying 'ct','D2inf', or 'both', where 'ct' returns
                only the correlation function, 'D2inf' only returns the equilibrium
                value of the correlation function, and 'both' returns both (ct 
                first, A, the equilibrium values, second). Again, running this
                function twice to get each parameter is slower than acquiring
                both simultaneously.
